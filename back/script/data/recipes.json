Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nPress one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.\nPlace sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.\nMake a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.\nFold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.\nRepeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.\nSlowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalie T\n", "rating": 4.8, "url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/", "nutrition": {"Total Fat": {"amount": "19g", "percent": "24%"}, "Saturated Fat": {"amount": "9g", "percent": "46%"}, "Cholesterol": {"amount": "31mg", "percent": "10%"}, "Sodium": {"amount": "124mg", "percent": "5%"}, "Total Carbohydrate": {"amount": "52g", "percent": "19%"}, "Dietary Fiber": {"amount": "3g", "percent": "10%"}, "Protein": {"amount": "2g", "percent": null}, "Vitamin C": {"amount": "5mg", "percent": "27%"}, "Calcium": {"amount": "23mg", "percent": "2%"}, "Iron": {"amount": "1mg", "percent": "6%"}, "Potassium": {"amount": "156mg", "percent": "3%"}}, "img_src": "https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/1I95oiTGz6aEpuHd2DAr33w7Mgg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/12682-apple-pie-by-grandma-ople-natasha-titanov-1x1-1-7f1cd9f631d24ff0b90cac0163247686.jpg", "diet": "vegetarian", "tags": ["contains_dairy", "contains_gluten", "high_FODMAP"]}, "9e5fe3d2-dfdc-4640-8e4a-8f69b05365de": {"recipe_name": "Sarah's Homemade Applesauce", "total_time_minutes": 25, "servings": 4, "ingredients": {"apples": {"amount": 4.0, "unit": null}, "water": {"amount": 180.0, "unit": "ml"}, "white sugar": {"amount": 60.0, "unit": "ml"}, "ground cinnamon": {"amount": 2.0, "unit": "ml"}}, "directions": "Combine apples, water, sugar, and cinnamon in a saucepan; cover and cook over medium heat until apples are soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nAllow apple mixture to cool, then mash with a fork or potato masher until it is the consistency you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by cookin'mama.\ncookin mama\n", "rating": 4.8, "url": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/51301/sarahs-applesauce/", "nutrition": {"Total Fat": {"amount": "0g", "percent": "0%"}, "Sodium": {"amount": "3mg", "percent": "0%"}, "Total Carbohydrate": {"amount": "32g", "percent": "12%"}, "Dietary Fiber": {"amount": "4g", "percent": "13%"}, "Total Sugars": {"amount": "27g", "percent": null}, "Protein": {"amount": "0g", "percent": null}, "Vitamin C": {"amount": "6mg", "percent": "32%"}, "Calcium": {"amount": "13mg", "percent": "1%"}, "Iron": {"amount": "0mg", "percent": "1%"}, "Potassium": {"amount": "150mg", "percent": "3%"}}, "img_src": "https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/VY5d0tZHB8xz6y-ef586jR050FE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/25840-Sarahs-Applesauce-2000-56080bc8aac64df59aeec895f1875fc0.jpg", "diet": "vegan", "tags": ["high_FODMAP"]}, "6c487cde-727b-4188-96c6-c8a0fecb8bcc": {"recipe_name": "Apple Crisp", "total_time_minutes": 75, "servings": 12, "ingredients": {"all-purpose apples": {"amount": 2400.0, "unit": "ml"}, "white sugar": {"amount": 240.0, "unit": "ml"}, "all-purpose flour": {"amount": 240.0, "unit": "ml"}, "ground cinnamon": {"amount": 5.0, "unit": "ml"}, "water": {"amount": 120.0, "unit": "ml"}, "quick-cooking oats": {"amount": 240.0, "unit": "ml"}, "brown sugar": {"amount": 240.0, "unit": "ml"}, "baking powder": {"amount": 1.0, "unit": "ml"}, "baking soda": {"amount": 1.0, "unit": "ml"}, "butter": {"amount": 120.0, "unit": "ml"}}, "directions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace sliced apples in a 9x13-inch baking dish.

The mixture will be shaggy at this point. From here, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons). Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it. Knead a few times until it comes together. Form dough into a disk.

In a medium bowl, toss together the pear slices, brown sugar, cocoa powder, coffee grounds, vanilla extract and salt.\nRemove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin.

Re-roll the scraps to get 1 additional circle.\nArrange the pears slices neatly in a circular pattern in the center of each of the pie crust rounds, leaving about 1 1/2 inch clear at the edges. Fold over the edges to cover about 1/2 inch of the filling. Repeat with the remaining rounds. Transfer the galettes to a baking sheet lined with Reynolds\u00ae Parchment Paper and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.\nLastly, brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Check on the galettes periodically. If at any time the crusts' edges are getting too brown, take a piece of Reynolds Wrap\u00ae Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges. When the edges are golden brown, remove from the oven.

Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses.

Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.\nFill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nDrain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.\nPlace the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.\nGently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.\nTest the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.\nPlace a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.\nMeanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes.\nGently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side.
